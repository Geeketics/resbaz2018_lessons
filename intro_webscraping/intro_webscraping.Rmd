Intro content from https://data-lessons.github.io/library-webscraping/ but modified to be in R

## What is web scraping?


Pull data from website, often unstructured

aims to transform specific content in website into structured form 



## Applications

- tracking trends in real estate market
- collect online article comments for analysis (using text mining)
- collecting archives of reports from many web pages

## Not web scraping

- data downloads
- semantic web knowledge bases (OWL)
- microformats

## Things to check

- check copy paste
    - excel/google sheets
- check for an API
- large requests could use Freedom of information act request

## Example: a database of UN Security Council Resolutions

http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/

## Task

Our task is to merge the data from all the UNSC resolution pages into a single, consistent and machine-readable format that will allow us to:

- count and plot how many resolutions were passed each year
- count and plot how many pertained UN membership vs. security motions
- search for resolutions pertaining to particular countriesâ€™ names
- divide the statistics by geopolitical region (e.g. South America vs. East Asia)
- periodically update our database as long as the web site maintains its current format


## Matching patterns

- regular expression
- XPath
- CSS selectors

## Markup languages

- XML
- HTML

## Structure of marked-up document

XML syntax rules

- XML structured using nodes
    - element nodes
    - attribute nodes
    - text nodes
- XML element nodes must have open and close tag
- XML tag names are case sensitive
- can have nested child elements
- XML attribute nodes have a name, and value that must be quoted

HTML has relaxed rules

- tag and attribute names are case insensitive
- some elements are closed automatically (e.g. <img>)
- attribute values fo not need to be quoted

##  Common HTML tags

p | a paragraph of text
h1 | top level heading
